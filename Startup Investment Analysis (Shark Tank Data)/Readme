# Shark Tank US Data Analysis with Power BI

This repository presents a data visualization project that explores investment patterns, gender dynamics, and industry trends from the US television show Shark Tank. Built using **Power BI**, the project analyzes deals made across multiple seasons and sheds light on who invests, when, and in what sectors.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of **deal-making behavior** in Shark Tank US. It focuses on:

- **Investor activity and investment amounts**
- **Industry-wise deal distributions**
- **Gender and team composition of entrepreneurs**
- **Seasonal trends in deal volume and funding**

## Files Included

- **sharktank.pbix** – Power BI dashboard file (editable project)
- **sharktank.pdf** – Exported version of dashboard visuals for quick reference

## Key Insights

- **Food and Beverage**, **Lifestyle/Home**, and **Fashion/Beauty** are the top-funded industries.
- **Season 11** recorded the highest number of funded deals (71).
- **Mark Cuban**, **Lori Greiner**, and **Barbara Corcoran** consistently led in total investment amount.
- Male-led and mixed-gender teams account for the majority of funded deals.
- Season-wise funding and investor activity show meaningful trends over time.
