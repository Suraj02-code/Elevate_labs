# Movie Success Prediction and Sentiment Study

This project explores two major aspects of film analytics: predicting the commercial success of movies based on metadata, and analyzing audience sentiment using natural language processing techniques. The project is divided into two tasks:

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Success Prediction

In this task, we aim to predict a movies success based on its metadata, including budget, runtime, genre, and cast information. Success is typically defined in terms of revenue generation or classification into profitable/unprofitable categories.

**Objective**: Build predictive models using supervised machine learning to classify or regress movie success.

**Tools & Techniques**:
- Data Preprocessing with pandas and NumPy
- Feature Engineering
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (R², MAE, MSE)

**Dataset**: IMDb/Kaggle Movie Metadata Dataset  
**Features include**:
- Title
- Budget
- Revenue
- Genres
- Director
- Cast
- IMDb Ratings
- Runtime
- Language
- Release Date

### Task 2: Sentiment Analysis of Viewer Reviews

This task analyzes the textual reviews of movies to assess viewer sentiment — whether the review was positive or negative.

**Objective**: Perform sentiment classification using NLP techniques on IMDb reviews.

**Tools & Techniques**:
- Text Cleaning and Preprocessing (stopwords removal, tokenization)
- Sentiment Scoring using:
  - VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
  - NLTK
  - TF-IDF with Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression

**Dataset**: IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset  
**Features**:
- Review Text
- Sentiment Label (positive / negative)
